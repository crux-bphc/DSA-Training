# Binary Search Tree (BST)

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child, and the topmost node in the tree is called the root. It additionally satisfies the binary search property, which states that the key in each node must be greater than or equal to any key stored in the left subtree, and less than or equal to any key stored in the right subtree.
